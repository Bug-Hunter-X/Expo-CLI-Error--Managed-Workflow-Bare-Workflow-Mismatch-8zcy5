The solution depends on which workflow you want to use. If you want to use the **managed workflow**, ensure your project is correctly set up and you are not attempting to use modules that require native interactions directly. If you want to use **bare workflow**, you will need to handle the builds via Xcode (iOS) or Android Studio (Android). You'll also need to install and manage the native dependencies yourself. For example, using `expo install react-native-camera` would be appropriate in a managed workflow, but you would use the standard native installation procedures in a bare workflow.  Properly setting up your environment for the chosen workflow is crucial.
