This error typically occurs when you try to use an Expo managed workflow feature in a bare workflow project, or vice versa.  Managed workflow uses Expo's own build system, while bare workflow lets you build your app with native tools.  Mixing these approaches can lead to conflicts and this error.  A common example is attempting to use `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android` in a bare workflow project, or trying to use native modules designed for bare workflows within an Expo managed workflow project.
